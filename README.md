### Connor's up

There are numerous missing components to this project, including a makefile, separate programs for indenting and dedenting, and allowing you to stream into the indent/dedent command. The program as it is reads directly from a file, not giving the user any options regarding fexibility of use. The code is mostly alright, though some sign warnings.
